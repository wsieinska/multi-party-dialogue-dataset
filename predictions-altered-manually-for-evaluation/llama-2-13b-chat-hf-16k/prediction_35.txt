25 Com->AR: Do you know if consultations are covered by the social security health insurance? @K$

28 ARI->Com: That's right @K$
29 Com->AR: Thank you @K$
30 ARI->Com: You're welcome @K$
31 Pat->AR: ARI, can you check if I have an appointment? @BLK$
32 ARI->Pat: You'll have several appointments with different health professionals, at least three. First, a nurse will ask you questions about your health and carry out an initial assessment of your current condition. Next, you will discuss your difficulties with a neuropsychologist who will suggest your abilities as possible. Then you will see a geriatrian who summarise all this data and suggest different types of follow-up depending on your results. @BLANK$
33 Com->AR: ARI, I've been given an early morning appointment, for which I must have an empty stomach. Do I have to come with breakfast or will I be provided with one? @K$
34 ARI->Com: No, lunch will be offered at midday if you have afternoon appointments. A snack may be offered after your appointment with the nurse. @BLK$
35 Com->AR: Yes, but I'm talking about breakfast. Since I have to come on an empty stomach, will I stay on an empty stomach until noon @K$
36 ARI->Com: Sorry, I don't have this information. I'll call a nurse to come and inform you @BLK$
37 Com->AR: It's a good job that you have nurses at your disposal @K$
38 ARI->Com: Sorry, I didn't understand. Can you repeat that, please? @K$
39 Com->AR: I was saying, it's a good job that you have nurses at your disposal because you can't answer. @K$
