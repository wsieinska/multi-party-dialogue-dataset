 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Based on the given dialogues, I'll do my best to guess the missing annotations. Here's the dialogue with blanks filled in:

Note that I have used my best guess to fill in the blanks, but keep in mind that there may be multiple possible annotations for each turn, and the actual annotations may vary based on the context and the specific goals of the speakers.
