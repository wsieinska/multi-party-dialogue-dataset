 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here are my guesses for the missing annotations:




1. ARI->Pat+Com: Hello, my name is ARI. How can I help you? @BLANK$
2 Pat->Com: Where can we eat? @BLANK$
3 Com->ARI: We'd like to know where we can eat. @BLANK$
4 ARI->Pat+Com: There's a cafeteria on the ground floor, near the courtyard. @BLANK$
5 Pat->Com: Are there toilets? And where are they? @BLANK$
6 Com->AR: Where are the toilets @BLANK$
7 ARI+Com: Very easy! You have to go to the corridor at the end of the room. @BLANK$
8 Pat->Com: Are they accessible by disabled people? @BLANK$
9 Com->AR: My... My friend doesn't walk very well, can he get into the toilets with his... his wheelchair? @BLANK$
10 ARI+Com: Yes, absolutely. @BLANK$
1 Pat->Com: I have an appointment in room 17, how do I get there? @BLANK$
112 Com->AR: And he's a bit lost. He's been asked to go to, go to room 17. Could you tell us where to go, please? @BLANK$
13 ARI+Com: Room 17 is on the second floor. You just have to go to the counter on the left and then a nurse will come and take care of you. The lifts are at the entrance on the left. @BLANK$
14 Pat->Com: Is wheelchair accessible? @BLANK$
15 Com->AR: Is the liftchair accessible? Can he use the lift? @BLANK$
16 ARI+Com: Yes, of course. @ANK$
17 Pat->Com: I have an appointment for 10 AM. How long... ah well... how long will I be waiting? @BLANK$
18 Com->AR: He has an appointment at 10 o'clock. Do you know if there is a waiting time, if he has time for a coffee or do we have to go straight to the treatment? @BLANK$
19 ARI+Com: I don't have this information @ANK$
20 Pat->Com: I don't know @BLANK$
2 ARI+Com: Thank you, see you around, have a nice day @ANK$




Note that I have used the same annotation for all the goals, as you can see from the examples, I have guessed that the goals are all of type "information seeking" (BLANK$).
