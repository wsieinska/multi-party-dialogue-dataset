Based on the example dialogues, the goal annotations seem to be in the format '@[GOAL]', where 'GOAL' is a brief description of the goal. Using this format, I can guess the missing goal annotations for the dialogue as follows:
```sql
01 ARI->Pat+Com: Hello, my name is ARI. How can I help you? @-
02 Pat->ARI: Where is room 17? @G(Pat, get-info(room(number)(location)))$
03 ARI->Pat: Room 17 is on the second floor. You just have to go to the counter on the left and then a nurse will come and take care of you. @AGP(Pat, get-info(room(number)(location)))$
04 Com->ARI: How do I get to room 17? Do I have to take the lift? @G(Com, get-info(room(number)(location)))$
05 ARI->Com: Room 17 is on the second floor. You just have to go to the counter on the left and then a nurse will come and take care of you. The lifts are at the entrance on the left. @AGP(Com, get-info(room(number)(location)))$
06 Pat->ARI: How long before my appointment? @G(Pat, get-info(appointment(time)))$
07 Com->ARI: ARI, can you... sorry... It isn't responding. @-
08 Com->ARI: ARI? @-
09 ARI->Pat: I don't have this information. I'll call a nurse to come and inform you. @-
10 Com->ARI: ARI, I don't have a watch, is there a clock in the room so I can find out the time? @G(Com, get-info(clock())$
11 ARI->Com: Sorry, I don't have this information. You have to go to the reception. @AGN(Com, get-info(clock())$
12 Com->ARI: Ah, never mind then. @-
13 Pat->ARI: Thank you ARI. @-
14 ARI->Pat: Thank you. @-
15 ARI->Pat+Com: Have a nice day. @-
16 Pat->ARI: You too. @-
```
So, the dialogue with blanks filled in is:
```sql
01 ARI->Pat+Com: Hello, my name is ARI. How can I help you? @-
02 Pat->ARI: Where is room 17? @G(Pat, get-info(room(number)(location)))$
03 ARI->Pat: Room 17 is on the second floor. You just have to go to the counter on the left and then a nurse will come and take care of you. @AGP(Pat, get-info(room(number)(location)))$
04 Com->ARI: How do I get to room 17? Do I have to take the lift? @G(Com, get-info(room(number)(location)))$
05 ARI->Com: Room 17 is on the second floor. You just have to go to the counter on the left and then a nurse will come and take care of you. The lifts are at the entrance on the left. @AGP(Com, get-info(room(number)(location)))$
06 Pat->ARI: How long before my appointment? @G(Pat, get-info(appointment(time)))$
07 Com->ARI: ARI, can you... sorry... It isn't responding. @-
08 Com->ARI: ARI? @-
09 ARI->Pat: I don't have this information. I'll call a nurse to come and inform you. @-
10 Com->ARI: ARI, I don't have a watch, is there a clock in the room so I can find out the time? @G(Com, get-info(clock())$
11 ARI->Com: Sorry, I don't have this information. You have to go to the reception. @AGN(Com, get-info(clock())$
12 Com->ARI: Ah, never mind then. @-
13 Pat->ARI: Thank you ARI. @-
14 ARI->Pat: Thank you. @-
15 ARI->Pat+Com: Have a nice day. @-
16 Pat->ARI: You too. @-
