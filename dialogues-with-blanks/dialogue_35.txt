04 Pat->ARI: From 11 AM to 3 PM. Ok, well thank you. @[BLANK]$
05 ARI->Pat: You're welcome. @[BLANK]$
06 Com->ARI: Is there hot chocolate in the cafeteria? @[BLANK]$
07 ARI->Com: No, you can order hot or cold sandwiches as well as hot or cold drinks. @[BLANK]$
08 Com->ARI: But in this case, is hot chocolate included under hot drinks? @[BLANK]$
09 ARI->Com: Sorry, could you repeat that? @[BLANK]$
10 Com->ARI: Yes, I was asking if I could possibly get a hot chocolate. @[BLANK]$
11 ARI->Com: Yes, of course. There's a coffee machine in the hallway entrance. @[BLANK]$
12 Com->ARI: Ah well, thank you. @[BLANK]$
13 Pat->ARI: ARI, where is room 17? @[BLANK]$
14 ARI->Pat: Room 17 is on the second floor. You just have to go to the counter on the left and then a nurse will come and take care of you. @[BLANK]$
15 Pat->ARI: But I have an appointment, I'm going to be late, I have an appointment. I have an appointment soon. @[BLANK]$
16 ARI->Pat: I'm sorry, but I can't help you. You have to go to the reception. @[BLANK]$
17 Pat->ARI: Wow, well, never mind then. @[BLANK]$
18 Pat->ARI: And where is the reception? @[BLANK]$
19 ARI->Pat: The reception is just behind me. Remember to take a ticket on your right. @[BLANK]$
20 Pat->ARI: Well. Thank you. @[BLANK]$
21 Com->ARI: If we forget to take a ticket, we can't be seen? @[BLANK]$
22 ARI->Com: No, you can't. @[BLANK]$
23 Com->ARI: Do I have to provide any documents, and if so, which ones? @[BLANK]$
24 ARI->Com: Sorry, I don't have this information. @[BLANK]$
25 Com->ARI: Do you know if consultations are covered by the social security health insurance? @[BLANK]$
26 ARI->Com: Yes, absolutely. @[BLANK]$
27 Com->ARI: Does it mean that you have to show your health insurance card? @[BLANK]$
28 ARI->Com: That's right. @[BLANK]$
29 Com->ARI: Thank you. @[BLANK]$
30 ARI->Com: You're welcome. @[BLANK]$
31 Pat->ARI: ARI, can you check if I have an appointment today? @[BLANK]$
32 ARI->Pat: You'll have several appointments with different health professionals, at least three. First, a nurse will ask you questions about your health and carry out an initial assessment of your current condition. Next, you will discuss your difficulties with a neuropsychologist who will suggest tests to assess your abilities as accurately as possible. Then, you will see a geriatrician who will summarise all this data and suggest different types of follow-up depending on your results. @[BLANK]$
33 Com->ARI: ARI, I've been given an early morning appointment, for which I must have an empty stomach. Do I have to come with breakfast or will I be provided with one? @[BLANK]$
34 ARI->Com: No, lunch will be offered at midday if you have afternoon appointments. A snack may be offered after your appointment with the nurse. @[BLANK]$
35 Com->ARI: Yes, but I'm talking about breakfast. Since I have to come on an empty stomach, will I stay on an empty stomach until noon? @[BLANK]$
36 ARI->Com: Sorry, I don't have this information. I'll call a nurse to come and inform you. @[BLANK]$
37 Com->ARI: It's a good job that you have nurses at your disposal ARI! @[BLANK]$
38 ARI->Com: Sorry, I didn't understand. Can you repeat that, please? @[BLANK]$
39 Com->ARI: I was saying, it's a good job that you have nurses at your disposal because you can't answer questions. @[BLANK]$
40 ARI->Pat+Com: Can I help you? @[BLANK]$
41 Com->ARI: Well no, I think it's a dead end. @[BLANK]$
42 ARI->Pat+Com: Thank you, see you later. @[BLANK]$
43 Pat->ARI: A long time... @[BLANK]$
44 ARI->Pat+Com: Have a nice day. @[BLANK]$
45 Pat->ARI: ... ARI, I've been waiting a long time, I'm tired. @[BLANK]$
46 ARI->Pat: I'll call a nurse to come and inform you. @[BLANK]$
47 Pat->ARI: Thank you. See you around. @[BLANK]$
